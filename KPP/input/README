MITgcm Nchannel Flat Run
(See Burns et al. 2015 - In prep for detailed explanation)

Similar set up to Abernathey 2011

Setup in Github repo here:
https://github.com/hlburns/MITgcmSetups/FlatSponge

Annotated data files.

This setup was ran in 9 different simulations varying data.rbcs relaxation timescale

This setup can be used as a basis for flat bottom channel models

Requires 300+ years to Spin up, (~2 weeks on 128 cores).

Suggestion, once happy with set up suppress diagnostics output and turn off layers package 
to give 25% + reduction on run time.
